# Introduction

This is the tutorial for the environment setting of the TechX computer vision track, which will help you set up everything you need for development. 👾Many detailed tutorials and documents are linked to the Badge Button below. If you wanna learn more, feel free to click it and explore it on your own! 

## What is Colab & Why Colab?
Collaboratory Platform, short for Colab, is an Integrated Developer Environment(IDE) developed by Google. It also functions as the developing platform in which we are going to write and test our code. A good weel could facilitate developers on a great scale. Therefore, choosing a well-integrated IDE would be crucial. Colab, as an online IDE, outperforms many other local IDE on three aspects: easy to deploy, easy to config, various computation resources.

## Task One: VPN Dependency

Make sure you have a VPN service; thus, you can use google, colab, etc. For ones who don't have VPN, TBD.

## Task Two: Set up your Google Account

If you already have a Google account, please skip this task. If you don't have a google account, please follow the instruction explicitly and make sure all the settings are correct. Quick Link to [google account instruction](https://github.com/techx-cv/Environment_Tutorial/blob/main/instructions/Google%20Account%20Registration.pdf).

## Task Three: Set up your Colab

Now we can access Colab; Follow the instruction and create your own Colab notebook. Quick Link to [Colab setting instruction](https://github.com/techx-cv/Environment_Tutorial/blob/main/instructions/Google%20Colab%20Instruction.pdf)

## Task Four: Advanced Setting in Colab

Now the basic configuration is all set. If you wanna know more about Colab, follow the additional instruction. Quick Link to [Advance config instruction](https://github.com/techx-cv/Environment_Tutorial/blob/main/instructions/Colab%20Advanced%20Setting%20Instruction.pdf)

## Task Five: Useful Commands
Please check the notebook in the [asset](https://github.com/techx-cv/Environment_Tutorial/blob/main/assets/Useful_commands.ipynb) or Colab to get learn some useful majic commands in the notebook.
